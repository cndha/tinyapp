# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full-stack web application built with **Node** and **Express** that allows users to shorten long URLs *(Ã  la bit.ly)*. Users are able to update the long URLs that pertain to a certain short link after creation, or discard the shortened link. A simple tool made to share content without taking up your sweet tweet characters, and replacing that eye-sore of a long URL nobody reads anyway. 


## Final Product

!["User's homepage: list of urls they have converted from long to short URLs. Long URLs can be edited and shortURLs can be discarded."](https://github.com/cndha/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/urls-page.png)

!["User's edit section. Long URLs can be edited to corresponding shortURL."](https://github.com/cndha/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/edit-page.png)
